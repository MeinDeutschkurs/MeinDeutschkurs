- 👋 Hi, I’m @MeinDeutschkurs
- 👀 I’m interested in lots of different things. Sometimes I have no idea what I want, but then it appars.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning everything and nothing. I love to get in touch with lots of different things and I hope to be smarter afterwards.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on finding ideas.
